AirPlay
<p>
OSMC supports AirPlay from iOS devices. OSMC has support for iOS 8 however AirPlay mirroring is not implemented. Further, some users have reported issues streaming 
audio with new versions of iTunes.

<p>
There are some third party solutions which provide AirPlay mirroring. We have tried to talk to these developers but they have not shown interest in helping enhance the OSMC experience by adding support.

<h2>Black screen streaming some content</h2>
<p>
Some content will only show a black screen with sound when you try and stream it. This typically indicates that the stream has DRM which prevents it from being 
freely streamed to another device.

<h2>Issues with YouTube</h2>
<p>
YouTube have changed their codec for the native iOS application. This means that AirPlay streaming from the application no longer works. However it is possible to stream 
YouTube videos from the Safari web browser.
