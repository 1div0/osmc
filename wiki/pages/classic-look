How to get the XBMC / Kodi classic look
<p>
OSMC ships with its own look and feel, however you may want to get the original look and feel of Kodi back. To do this, go to System -> Settings -> Appearance. Under 'Skin', select 'Confluence'. This will give you the original look and feel that you may be used to from Raspbmc or Crystalbuntu.
