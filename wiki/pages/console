Getting to the Terminal
<p>
You can get to the console in two ways:
<ul>
	<li>Logging in via SSH using an SSH client on a Windows, Mac or Linux system</li>
	<li>A local console login, using a connected keyboard</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Logging in locally</h2>
<p>
You can log in locally by exiting Kodi:
<ul>
	<li>Navigate to the power icon in Kodi</li>
	<li>Select Exit/Quit</li>
	<li>Wait for the OSMC splash screen to appear 
	<li>Press ESC on your keyboard</li>
	<li>Login to your device using osmc for the username and password.</li>
</ul>
From RC3 onwards there are some additional ways to log in to the local console:
<ul>
	<li>During boot hold down the CTRL key on your keyboard</li>
	<li>After a few seconds you will be taken directly to a login screen rather than Kodi.
	<li>Login to your device using osmc for the username and password.</li>
</ul>
For an emergency root recovery console:
<ul>
	<li>During boot hold down the SHIFT key on your keyboard, you should be taken directly to a command prompt</li>
	<li>If it boots as normal try shutting down and powering off, then holding down shift before turning the power on</li>
</ul>
In the recovery console you will have root access, no services will be running and no network connection will be active but you will be able to edit and copy files and perform other basic configuration/recovery tasks.
<p>
One final boot option is an automatic check for updates, useful if you cannot perform updates from OSMC settings for any reason:
<ul>
	<li>During boot hold down both the SHIFT and CTRL keys together until you see the blue update screen</li>
	<li>A full update will now occur then Kodi will start</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Logging in via SSH</h2>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Windows users can download an SSH client called PuTTY <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">here</a>.</li>
	<li>Linux and OS X users should have an SSH client already</li>
	<li>You can find your device's IP address in Settings -&gt; System Info -&gt; Network</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Run Putty and enter the IP address of your device and click OK</li>
	<li>When prompted, enter osmc for both username and password</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Linux / OS X</h3>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Open a Terminal interface and run the following command:
<pre>ssh osmc@X.Y.Z</pre>
</li>
</p>
<p>
	<li>Be sure to substitute your IP address in the command above.</li>
	<li>You will be prompted to accept the SSH key if this is the first time you have connected to the device. Type yes</li>
	<li>Enter osmc as the password</li>
</ul>
</p>
