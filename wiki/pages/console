Getting to the Terminal
You can get to the console in three ways:
<ul>
	<li>Log in via the web interface</li>
	<li>Logging in via SSH using an SSH client on a Windows, Mac or Linux system</li>
	<li>By exiting Kodi</li>
</ul>
<h2>Logging in via the web interface</h2>
This is the easiest way and lets you access the Terminal without a keyboard attached to your device or needing to download and configure an SSH client.
<ul>
	<li>Find your device's IP address in Settings -&gt; System Info -&gt; Network</li>
	<li>Go to the following URL in your browser:
<pre>http://IP:4200</pre>
</li>
	<li>Substitute the IP address you found earlier</li>
</ul>
<h2>Logging in via SSH</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Windows users can download an SSH client called PuTTY <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">here</a>.</li>
	<li>Linux and OS X users should have an SSH client already</li>
	<li>You can find your device's IP address in Settings -&gt; System Info -&gt; Network</li>
</ul>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Run Putty and enter the IP address of your device and click OK</li>
	<li>You will be prompted to enter your username and password</li>
</ul>
<h3>Linux / OS X</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Open a Terminal interface and run the following command:
<pre>ssh osmc@X.Y.Z</pre>
</li>
	<li>Be sure to substitute your IP address in the command above.</li>
	<li>You will be prompted to accept the SSH key if this is the first time you have connected to the device. Type yes</li>
	<li>Enter the password</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exiting Kodi</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Navigate to the power icon in Kodi</li>
	<li>Select Exit</li>
	<li>Press ESC on your keyboard</li>
	<li>Login to your device.</li>
</ul>
