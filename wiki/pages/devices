Supported devices
<p>
OSMC is a cross-platform media center and runs on a multitude of devices. If there is significant demand for a device and we can support it, we will do so. Here's what we currently run on:
</p>
<h2>Vero</h2>
<p>
Vero is OSMC's flagship device. It is the best way to enjoy OSMC and comes with all the essentials you need to get started out of the box. If you're someone who takes their TV seriously, check out Vero <a href="https://getvero.tv" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<h2>Raspberry Pi</h2>
<p>
OSMC runs on all models of Raspberry Pi. We recommend you use a Class 10 SD card, a stable power supply, and the Pi Model 2 with 1GB RAM for the best experience.
</p>
<h2>Apple TV</h2>
<p>
OSMC will run on the 1st generation Apple TV in the future. You can install a Crystal HD acceleration card (outlined in our <a href="http://osmc.tv/help/wiki/">Wiki</a>) for improved HD playback. OSMC is the only way of running the latest version of Kodi with Crystal HD support on Apple TV.
</p>
<h2>i.MX6</h2>
<p>
OSMC will run on most i.MX6 devices in the future. We recommend you use a Class 10 SD card and a stable power supply for the best experience.
