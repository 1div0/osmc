Starting and stopping Kodi
<h2>Starting Kodi</h2>
<p>
Kodi should start by default with OSMC. If it does not, this is likely a sign of a bigger problem with your system and you should look at obtaining some logs instead.
</p>
<p>
It can be started via the command line as follows:
<pre>sudo systemctl start mediacenter</pre>
</p>
<h2>Stopping Kodi</h2>
<p>
Kodi can be stopped via the command line as follows:
<pre>sudo systemctl stop mediacenter</pre>
</p>
<h2>Preventing Kodi from starting on boot</h2>
<p>
You can disable Kodi from starting on boot with the following command:
<pre>sudo systemctl disable mediacenter</pre>
If you choose to later re-enable it, you can easily do so with:
<pre>sudo systemctl enable mediacenter</pre>
</p>
