Kernel configuration
<p>
OSMC does not expose the kernel configuration via /proc/config.gz as we prefer to reduce the kernel footprint as much as possible. Instead, we store the kernel configuration in /boot.

To check what kernel version you are running, type the following at the command line:
<pre>uname -r</pre>
