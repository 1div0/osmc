What is the difference between Kodi and OSMC?
<p>
<a href="http://kodi.tv">Kodi</a> is a media center application and OSMC is the operating system that runs Kodi and brings it to your device. OSMC is not a fork of Kodi but rather a Linux distribution that ships Kodi as the main application. This is a similar concept to Kodi running on top of Windows or Android.

<p>
OSMC is based on <a href="http://debian.net">Debian</a> Jessie (a flavour of GNU/Linux) and has been heavily optimised to provide the best TV experience possible. OSMC is in charge of:
<ol>
<li>Keeping your system up to date</li>
<li>Hardware management (handling devices such as remotes, keyboards, WiFi adapters etc)</li>
<li>Managing system resources</li>
</ol>
OSMC has over 30,000 packages made available via the Debian repositories as well as an App Store.
