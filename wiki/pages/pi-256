Lower specification Pis
<p>
OSMC will run on Raspberry Pi devices with 256MB RAM. OSMC installations on these devices will have a swapfile enabled on first install and a variety of tweaks to improve performance and reduce 
the impact of low memory as much as possible. The difference between a 256MB Pi and a 512MB Pi is noticeable however.

<p>
We recommend that you limit the number of applications you install from the App Store on these devices as running many applications may cause your device to run out of memory quickly and cause 
a subpar TV watching experience.
