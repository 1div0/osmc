Causes of a black screen during playback
<p>
There are two main causes of a black screen during playback. One is that the file you are trying to play may contain an unsupported video codec. There is not much that 
OSMC cannot play, so this is less likely. The more likely reason is that you are trying to play VC1 or MPEG2 content. Most live TV uses the MPEG2 codec.

<h2>Jerky playback</h2>
<p>
You may experience stutters or unsmooth playback if you do not have the codecs installed as the Raspberry Pi is then forced to try and play this with software decoding. This
is taxing on the CPU and may not be possible depending on the content you are playing. The original Raspberry Pi in particular will struggle with software decoding of video.

<h2>Codec licenses</h2>

Codec licenses can be purchased from the <a href="https://osmc.tv/help/wiki/pi-buycodec">Raspberry Pi foundation</a>
