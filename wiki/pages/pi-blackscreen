Causes of a black screen during playback
<p>
There are two main causes of a black screen during playback. One is that the file you are trying to play may contain an unsupported video codec. There is not much that
OSMC cannot play, so this is less likely. The more likely reason is that you are trying to play VC1 or MPEG2 content. Most live TV uses the MPEG2 codec. These need codec licenses which can be purchased
<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.com/>here</a> from the Raspberry Pi foundation.

You'll need the serial number of your device before purchasing. This can be obtained from Settings -> System Info. After a small period of time, you will get an email
with your codecs. These can be entered via My OSMC -> Pi Settings. After a reboot, you will now be able to play VC1 and MPEG2 content.
