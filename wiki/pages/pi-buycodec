Buying the MPEG2 and VC1 codecs
<p>
You can buy the codecs <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.com/">here</a> from the Raspberry Pi foundation.
</p>
<p>
You'll need the serial number of your device before purchasing. This can be obtained from Settings -> System Info. After a small period of time, you will get an email 
with your codecs. These can be entered via My OSMC -> Pi Settings. After a reboot, you will now be able to play VC1 and MPEG2 content.
