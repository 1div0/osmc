Pi sound cards
<p>
There are two types of sound cards that can be added to the Raspberry Pi. These are USB sound cards and I2S sound cards.
</p>
<h2>USB sound cards</h2>
<p>
USB sound cards will work without any complex set up. Simply go to Settings -> Audio Output and select your device from there.
</p>
<h2>I2S sound cards</h2>
<p>
I2S sound cards such as HifiBerry need to be enabled in My OSMC. To do this, go to My OSMC -> Enable Pi features. You will now see a list of optional modules which
you can enable. Select HifiBerry and the appropriate model and click OK. After a reboot, you will now be able to select this sound card via Settings -> Audio Output.
