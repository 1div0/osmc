USB installations
<p>
OSMC can be installed to a USB on Raspberry Pi. You will still need the SD card attached, as this is used by the device to boot. The main operating system however will be
stored and run off of the USB stick or hard drive attached.

This can provide a performance boost as USB installations can provide faster read and write speeds than the embedded SD controller. Although the Pi has USB 2.0 ports, OSMC
recommends using a USB 3.0 drive, as this will ensure you fully saturate the USB 2.0 port and take advantage of its speed. USB 2.0 drives can vary in speed so by using a 3.0 rated
one, you are ensuring you will get the best USB 2.0 performance possible.
