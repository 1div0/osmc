Raspberry Pi 2 and Codecs
<p>
It is still recommended that you purchase the codec packs from Raspberry Pi. These allow the device to decode MPEG2 and VC1 in hardware. If the codec packs are not present, then
the device will attempt to play them in software using the CPU. This will work for SD material, however more demanding content may be problematic for the device. If you are planning to watch
High Definition MPEG2 or VC1 content, we recommend you purchase the codec packs from the <a href="https://osmc.tv/help/wiki/pi-buycodec">Raspberry Pi foundation</a>
