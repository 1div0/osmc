Acquiring a system log
<p>
The system log on OSMC is not persistent across reboots. This means that when you obtain a log, you are obtaining the latest log since the device was last booted. Firstly, <a href="http://osmc.tv/help/wiki/console">you'll need to get command line access</a>.
</p>
<h2>Saving the log to a file</h2>
<p>
The system log can be saved to a file with the following command:
<pre>sudo journalctl | sudo tee /home/osmc/system-log</pre>
This will create a file in your home directory called system-log.
</p>
<h2>Uploading the log to the OSMC Pastebin</h2>
<p>
If you'd like to upload the log to get some help, then you can upload directly to the OSMC Pastebin from the command line by running the following command:
<pre>sudo journalctl | paste</pre>
This will give you a URL that you can then use on our forums or in IRC. Please note that this may not work for large logs.
