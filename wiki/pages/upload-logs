Uploading logs
OSMC hosts its own Pastebin that is ad-free for users to upload logs to. You can find it at <a href="http://paste.osmc.io" target="_blank">http://paste.osmc.io</a>. Please use it responsibly.
<h2>Uploading via the command line</h2>
OSMC's Pastebin supports uploading via the command line. This allows you to upload logs directly from your device instead of having to transfer them to an intermediate device.

After logging in to your device and <a href="http://osmc.tv/help/wiki/console">getting to the console</a>, you can 'pipe' most commands to paste to upload the output online.  For example:
<pre>echo "Hello World" | paste</pre>
will return a URL containing the above text. To upload a file called /home/osmc/somefile.log, you would run:
<pre>cat /home/osmc/somefile.log | paste</pre>
Please note that this may not work for larger logs.
