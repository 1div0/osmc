Removing Vero's SD card

<p>
The SD card can be removed for all models of Vero if you would like to reimage it or upgrade the default storage. Older versions of Vero require tweezers to get the SD card out, however newer versions have a push-push mechanism on the SD slot which allow for quick removal.
