Supported WiFi and TV adapters

<p>
OSMC supports most WiFi and TV adapters out of the box without any additional setup. It is difficult to provide an exact list of devices supported because of the large amount of adapters out there.
</p>
<p>
Supported devices can sometimes vary between different OSMC devices as well as they may be using a different version of the Linux kernel. To get support, you should raise an issue on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/samnazarko/osmc/issues/new">here</a> if it is not supported and we will do our best to get it included in the next release.
</p>
<p>
When making an issue, please be sure to upload <pre>dmesg</pre> output from your OSMC system with the device attached. This will help us identify the vendor and product.
